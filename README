This program reads input from a file and dynamically populates a web page with the retrieved data in the About section. 
The data includes details such as the room number, room name, device model, service provider, firmware

The web page displays information for two different rooms. The initial styles are defined in a CSS file, 
while additional styles and label names are managed through JavaScript.
